<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I am Senior Systems Analyst at Accenture, working for Microsoft as Consultant since December 2010. I am focused on designing, developing and deploying applications and services using Microsoft technologies such as Azure, SQL Azure, WCF and ASP.Net. I have worked on many client facing projects and prototypes using Azure and was involved in architecting, estimating and delivering them. I was the core part of the MSIT’s biggest migration to Azure.</p>
